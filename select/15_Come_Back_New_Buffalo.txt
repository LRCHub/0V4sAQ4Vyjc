Come Back

When dark as night
I saw the light
It shone with more
Desire than
I'd seen before
The leaves begin to fall
I smell the air
And hear a voice saying
Come back
Come back
I need you now
Come back
Come back
I need you now

It's time to lie
Down on the shore
Where you once cried
For more, for more
Come back
Come back
I need you now
Come back
Come back
I need you now

It's true
It's true
I've been avoiding you
When all you gave to me
Was so pure and so complete
The sounds that lull to sleep
The flickering of the lights
The water so deep
Come back
Come back
I need you now
Come back
Come back
I need you now

It's time to lie
Down on the shore
Where you once cried
For more, for more
Come back
Come back
I need you now
Come back
Come back
I need you now
