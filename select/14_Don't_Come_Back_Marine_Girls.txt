Don't come here try talking to me
Why don't hang yourself from the nearest tree
I don't want to hear, hear what you have to say
Here's your coat and the door is that way

I am sick of you bring me down
You been messing my heart around
I just can't take any more
So let me show you the door

I was having fun until you came
You strolled right in and you called my name
You can't believe what I'm saying
If you're leaving then baby I'm staying

You've gone now, how could I let you?
Nothing but tears since I met you
You are off to the railway tracks
And get out of my life and don't come back
Don't come back
Don't come back
Don't come back

:)
